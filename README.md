<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
I was working on my fishing achievements but got extemely tired of opening the hero panel over and over to check my progress and fish information. I wanted an complete display of the my fishing progress as well as what bait, hole, and time I needed for the rest of my achievement progress. Thus I created this application to both display the relevant information as well as track my current progress.

![Example image of application](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16658359/190915307-7b492421-3b26-4522-8d35-8061c784c500.png)
